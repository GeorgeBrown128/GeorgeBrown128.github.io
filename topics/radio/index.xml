      <description>Through the first half of 2016, British astronaut Tim Peake was aboard the ISS. During this time he carried out a number of 2m FM voice contacts with schools..
For the first few contacts, I used a Baofeng handy with a 2m whip antenna, which worked quite well for listening in, but it was not ideal. I also tried using my very basic \(\frac{1}{2}\lambda\) antenna. This didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work much better, and I was starting to notice some pager interference coming in too.</description>
