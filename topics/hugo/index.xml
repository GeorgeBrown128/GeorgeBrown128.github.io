      <description>For a long time, I was running a webserver that served up a few handwritten HTML pages. I&amp;rsquo;d used the Bootstrap to try and make the content a bit prettier, but it was never that great. In addition I was rarely able to add content, since writing HTML is a relatively slow and boring process.
My friend Harry Beadle showed me how he&amp;rsquo;d started writing his website in markdown, using Jekyll to convert the files into a complete website.</description>
