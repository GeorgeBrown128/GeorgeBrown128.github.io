<p>I recently purchased a set of 12 IN-12A (ИН-12А) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">nixie
tubes</a> from Russia. I was eager to
try them out and make sure they survived the trip. For this I built a very
basic high voltage power supply to fire them up, and then got a bit carried
away!</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000">This article concerns the use of a relatively
high voltage supply. Stay safe when working with high voltage, and do not
proceed until you are comfortable with the required precautions. Any attempt
to replicate these experiments is at your own risk!</span></p>

<h1 id="nixie-tubes">Nixie Tubes</h1>

<p>You&rsquo;ve no doubt seen nixie tubes by now. For the uninitiated, they were a
form of numeric display used before the advent of 7-segment LED displays. A
glass envelope encloses an mostly neon atmosphere, along with cathodes in the
shape of numerals, and a anode grid. When a high voltage is applied between
the anode and one of the cathodes, the numeral glows.</p>

<p>There has been something of a resurgence in their use, especially by makers.
There are hundreds of nixie tube clocks out there, along with some other novel
uses.</p>

<p>My nixies seem to be Soviet new-old-stock, produced in May of 1984. (I assume
05⊙84 is the date code.)</p>


<div class="pure-u-1-1">

</div>


<h1 id="the-power-supply">The Power Supply</h1>

<p>Nixies are gas-discharge tubes, and consequently exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_resistance#Negative_differential_resistance">negative differential
resistance</a>.
This wonderfully titled phenomenon means that in practical terms, we need a
higher voltage to turn the tube on that we do to run it. The turn on voltage
is called the &ldquo;striking voltage&rdquo;. Once the tube is &ldquo;struck&rdquo; a sustaining
voltage keeps the discharge going.</p>

<p>For the IN12A, the striking voltage is ≤ 170 V, while the sustaining voltage
is ≥ 120 V. The sustaining current is ≤ 2.5 mA. The challenge here then is not
the amount of power required, but the high voltages involved.</p>

<p>The usual approach is to build a boost converter to take around 12 V and step
it up to the required high voltage. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t have the
appropriate parts to hand. The mains however is a more than capable source of
these high voltages!</p>

<p>An isolation transformer would be an ideal safe place to start this project,
but unfortunately I don&rsquo;t own one. What I did have to hand though were a pair
of low power 12 V transformers.</p>

<p>Connecting the secondaries together and putting 240 V on one primary got me
about 200 V at the other primary. This was expected, and is a result of a
mixture of losses between the two transformers. The lower voltage is actually
ideal for this project.</p>

<p>A single diode half wave rectifier, a high voltage electrolytic capacitor, an
a bleeder resistor were all that was required to obtain a 210V DC rail. The
supply was placed inside the plastic enclosure of a 40A isolator. As an
additional safety feature I set this up so that I could short out the supply
while it was not switched on.</p>

<h2 id="ballast-resistor">Ballast Resistor</h2>

<p>To keep the nixie tube from drawing excessive current after striking, a ballast
resistor is needed to limit the current. The calculation of this resistor is
much like that for an LED.</p>

<p>$$ \frac{V_\text{supply} - V_\text{sustain}}{I_\text{sustain}} =
R_\text{ballast} $$</p>

<p>In this case the ballast resistor can be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{210 \text{V} - 120\text{V} }{2.5 \text{mA}} = 36 \text{k}\Omega $$</p>

<h1 id="the-first-illumination">The First Illumination</h1>

<p>Keeping a close eye on the current and voltage, the supply was turned on.
After a second the nixie popped into life and I was presented with a brilliant
orange number 4.</p>

<p>
<div class="pure-u-1-3">

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="pure-img" src="img/illuminated-4-800.jpg" alt="An illuminated 4 in a nixie tube.">
</div>
</p>

<p>Some later testing revealed that \(V_\text{sustain}\) was actually 134 V. I
ended up using a 33 kΩ resistor. This gave an operating current
of 1.75 mA, and a more than bright enough digit to read clearly in bright
light.</p>

<h1 id="looping-digits">Looping Digits</h1>

<p>After getting a single digit to light up, I was eager to start controlling the
tube. A simple demonstration would be to cycle through the digits.</p>

<p>I built up a simple 4017 counter. Unfortunately I could only find 4
transistors capable of handling the high \(V_\text{CE}\) required, so I only got
to loop 4 digits. I&rsquo;m still very pleased with the result so far!</p>

<h1 id="schematic">Schematic</h1>

<p>Please excuse the WhiteboardCAD schematic. It&rsquo;s not 100% complete, but it gets the point across!</p>

<h1 id="power-up-characteristics">Power Up Characteristics</h1>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to see the power on characteristic of the
tube on the scope. <span style="color: #ff0000">Note that you could <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaELqAo4kkQ">blow
up</a> your scope if you&rsquo;re not
careful here!</span></p>

<p>
<div class="pure-u-1-1">
  <img class="pure-img" src="img/rise-far-800.jpg" alt="Scope trace from power on to strike.">
</div>

Here you can see the power supply voltage rising up, and then the strike point
itself. The lumpy rise is a result of the half wave rectification.</p>

<p>
<div class="pure-u-1-1">
  <img class="pure-img" src="img/rise-close-800.jpg" alt="Scope trace showing around the strike point.">
</div>

Closer to the strike point, you can see the strike event itself is very
sudden, dropping about 10 volts.</p>

<p>
<div class="pure-u-1-1">
  <img class="pure-img" src="img/strike-800.jpg" alt="Scope trace showing the strike itself.">
</div>

Finally, the strike point itself. The strike takes about 400 µs. That&rsquo;s a
change of about 25 kV/s.</p>
