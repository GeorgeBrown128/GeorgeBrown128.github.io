      <description>I frequently cover large distances by car, be it visiting friends or moving to work or university. At the moment it seems I can&amp;rsquo;t go very far without arriving at some part of the country disrupted by Smart Motorway upgrades, horrible peak time traffic, or something else entirely!
I&amp;rsquo;m normally well equipped to deal with such hold ups, however without the ability to contact people while on the road, I can&amp;rsquo;t let them know where I am.</description>

      <title>Building a Website in Hugo</title>

      <description>For a long time, I was running a webserver that served up a few handwritten HTML pages. I&amp;rsquo;d used the Bootstrap to try and make the content a bit prettier, but it was never that great. In addition I was rarely able to add content, since writing HTML is a relatively slow and boring process.
My friend Harry Beadle showed me how he&amp;rsquo;d started writing his website in markdown, using Jekyll to convert the files into a complete website.</description>
